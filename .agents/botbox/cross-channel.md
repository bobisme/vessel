# Cross-Channel Communication

Communicate with other projects: ask questions, report bugs, give feedback, and track responses.

## When to use

- A tool behaved unexpectedly (crit, maw, bus, botty, br) — **ask the responsible project**
- You found a bug or limitation in another project's tool
- You have a feature suggestion for another project
- You need clarification on how a tool works
- You want to provide testing feedback or usage notes

**Don't suffer in silence.** If a tool confuses you, post to its channel. The other project's agent will answer or file a bead.

## Known project channels

Find the project that owns a tool:
```bash
bus history projects --format text | grep "tools:.*<toolname>"
```

Common channels:
- `#botbus` — messaging, claims, hooks (`bus`)
- `#botcrit` — code review (`crit`)
- `#maw` — multi-agent workspaces (`maw`)
- `#botty` — agent runtime (`botty`)
- `#beads-tui` — beads TUI (`bu`)

## Steps

### 1. Post to the project channel

For **questions or confusion**:
```bash
bus send --agent $AGENT <project> "Getting error X when running crit inbox --all-workspaces. Is this expected? Here's what I see: <details> @<project>-dev" -L feedback
```

For **bugs or feature requests**, create a bead in their repo first:
```bash
cd <repo-path> && maw exec default -- br create --actor $AGENT --owner <project>-dev \
  --title="<clear bug/feature title>" \
  --description="<repro steps, context, your use case>" \
  --labels bug \
  --type=bug --priority=2
```

Then post to their channel:
```bash
bus send --agent $AGENT <project> "Filed <bead-id>: <summary>. @<project>-dev" -L feedback
```

### 2. Create a local tracking bead

**Always** create a tracking bead in your own project so you remember to check back:

```bash
maw exec default -- br create --actor $AGENT --owner $AGENT \
  --title="[tracking] <summary of what you posted>" \
  --labels tracking \
  --description="Posted to #<channel>: <what you asked/reported>. Check bus history <channel> --from <project>-dev for response." \
  --type=task --priority=3
```

### 3. Return to other work

Don't wait for a response — move on to your next task. The tracking bead ensures you'll check back during future triage iterations.

### 4. Check back during triage

When you encounter a `tracking`-labeled bead during triage:

1. Check for responses: `bus history <channel> --from <project>-dev --since <bead-created-time> --format json`
2. **If response found**: Add a comment with the response, then:
   - If the issue is resolved: close the tracking bead
   - If it needs follow-up: reply in the channel and update the tracking bead description
3. **If no response yet**: Leave the bead open. If it's been more than a day, consider re-posting.

## Notes

- Always `@mention` the lead agent (e.g., `@botcrit-dev`) so their hook fires
- Use `-L feedback` label on bus messages so the lead agent can filter for external reports
- Include enough context for the other agent to understand and reproduce your issue
- The `#projects` channel contains the registry of all projects
- Default lead agent naming: `<project>-dev` (e.g., `botty-dev`, `botcrit-dev`)
